BuildingMenu should include a tile view of buildings that can be built.
These tile views should each be buttons that can be disabled or enabled, greyed out when disabled.
When pressed, these buttons will make the player enter "Build Mode", passing relevant information on to other systems.
This will remove the need for the "Build Mode" button, so it can be removed.
There should be a key binding that exits build mode.
Building a building should not exit build mode.
When built, an event should fire with information about the new building.
The widget should always be on screen at the bottom.
