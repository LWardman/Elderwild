Inhabitance component can be reused for work places, but needs to have a way to manually assign workers

A new component should be made in Creatures/Components/ which should be extremely similar to a ResidentComponent,
except that instead of being AHouse*, the class would instead be AWorkBuilding* or something of the sort.
This raises a DRY issue, so it could be an idea to make a UBuildingAssignmentComponent class,
then give ACreature multiple components of this class with names like "HomeAssignment" and "WorkAssignment".
